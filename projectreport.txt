Project Report: AI-Powered Face Recognition System
Submitted by: Amaragonda Adhithya
Project Type: Computer Vision, AI & Machine Learning
Tech Stack: Python, OpenCV, Flask, MySQL, ONNX, Railway, Render
Deployment: Cloud-based (Render for web service, Railway for database)
1️⃣ Introduction
Face recognition is one of the most widely used applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision (CV). It is implemented in various domains such as security systems, biometric authentication, surveillance, and attendance monitoring.

This project aims to build a real-time AI-powered face recognition system that can:

Detect faces using OpenCV's Haarcascade classifier.

Recognize faces by extracting deep learning-based embeddings using a pre-trained ONNX model.

Store face embeddings in a MySQL database and retrieve them for real-time recognition.

Deploy the system on Render (Flask-based web app) and store data on Railway (MySQL database).

2️⃣ Objective
The main goal of this project is to create an efficient and accurate face recognition system that can:
✅ Automatically detect and recognize faces.
✅ Store and manage face data in a database.
✅ Allow manual addition and deletion of faces through a web interface.
✅ Deploy the system to a cloud-based environment for accessibility.

3️⃣ Technologies Used
Technology	Purpose
Python	Main programming language
Flask	Web framework for deploying the system
OpenCV	Face detection and image processing
ONNX Model	Pre-trained deep learning model for face recognition
MySQL (Railway DB)	Storing face embeddings and names
JavaScript & HTML	Frontend for live streaming and database management
Render	Cloud deployment for web service
Railway	Cloud database hosting
4️⃣ Methodology
Step 1: Face Detection
Used OpenCV's Haarcascade Frontal Face Detector to detect faces in webcam frames.

Converts the captured frame to grayscale and detects faces in real time.

Step 2: Face Recognition
Once a face is detected, the face embedding is extracted using an ONNX deep learning model.

The embedding is compared with stored embeddings in the MySQL database to find a match.

If similarity exceeds a threshold (0.55 cosine similarity), the name is displayed; otherwise, it is marked as "Unknown".

Step 3: Database Management (MySQL on Railway)
The face embeddings are stored as comma-separated vectors in a table named known_faces.

Users can manually add faces, and the system stores their name along with the embedding.

The system provides an Admin Panel to view, delete, or update face data.

Step 4: Web Interface & Deployment
A Flask backend is used to handle video stream processing.

A JavaScript frontend captures video frames and sends them to the Flask API for processing.

The project is deployed using Render (Web Service) & Railway (Database).
